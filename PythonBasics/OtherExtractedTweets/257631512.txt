welcome to the amazing world of uni or how to spend 80 % of your energy into fighting with administration ... fighting cutie

i still am btw and i just woke up e__e 
family members or friends xd earned me xd 
honestly they didn't do so bad given the material ( i'm having a hard time finishing the manga otl ) but liar game's author is

it's really rare to have a teacher genuinely concerned about its students and really implicated in their progression 
non on est pareilles on est sœur de flippe 
omg ouiii 
casually talk to them ? " did we have any homework ? " " what page are we on " and adding that throughout time starts things ! 
no idea what time mama starts but i guess i'll catch up later ? i wanna see just shinee live but i don't have the time to wait 
attend je te sms xd 
and i kinda want to mess with taemin's face with prosthetics ... i mean he's so pretty i wanna try making him horrific ! 
than the 2 € sandwiches of my cafeteria where there's just bread butter and ham ... 
my teacher is making jokes i can't even xd

pewdie utilise aussi tweetbot 8D 
long , and what kept me going is how hooked the drama got me > < 
i didn't close my tumbler well and only noticed it when hot tea poured onto my thighs ... 
like i didn't see the point of taemin in henry's trap . i enjoyed it because kh and tm were ok in it but i didn't see the point of doing that 
it's driving me crazy . i know i can bear with it a while longer . but if i don't go there last summer and take a breather i will lose it 
with my studies but also feel important and not be just a number ( which is really important for me ) 
i might be wrong sometimes and nothing would be more useful than a good convo about that 
as she said , i need to be more honest towards my feelings ... 
je prends ! 
both ! the drama is veeery close to the manga ^ ^ 
hahaha yeaaah xd 
why is there a goddam mine here and why do i have to get in here ... i know jumpscares are coming 
i guess the fever is making me talk too much xd back to bed ! 
? ? ? 
the bad news is ... if my fav teacher can't add me to his class i'll be going back home hella late and i wanna nap / work 
the more i think about it the less i wanna tell him 
the clip is like ... no the only thing i liked was the quality of the rap 
are heavily choice driven and cry's lp didn't satisfy me and i wanna do my own choices xd 
now i understand how it works and it's genius 
i could listen to this track for ever ... 
yeah and also when you play you project partly in the character so it's scarier ; ; 
it's stifling there ... i want the freedom , the happiness i had there ... just thinking i need to wait 10 more months 
if i didn't . and i'm still struggling for the few things i really wanna do . those are very difficult and will take a whole lot time 
oh parle moiii 
nisekoi doumei ? 
jai rien dis xd un ctrl-alt-sup ça lui a foutu un coup de speed xd 
yeees 
well i don't think it sucks because it's an otoge since other had nice animes but i think this otome in particular is bad and
