argh ! horrendous colleague just told a customer that she would give them an ' exact eta . ' am getting closer than ever to grinding my teeth . 
it's astonishing , isn't it ? i swung into work blissed out on a happy , easy morning , & then got viciously mauled by stupid . #deepbreaths . 
i'm coral ! what's your earth day #googledoodle quiz animal ? !LINK! i'm quietly happy about this ! :) 
my employer's spirit animal's undoubtedly an ostrich . head in sand , permanently . suspect that's not good ! excellent piece . :) 
oh , it's ludicrous . i can't imagine who allowed it to be released and it's all teh-ribly teh-ribly . but mr . k is lush . 
oh , sorry , i've muddled up my twitter feeds so i'm posting from the wrong a / c . you're used to seeing instead . argh . 
close your eyes : leaving aside the incest , clive owen & alan rickman are sexy as fuck . #sorry #itswrongtoobjectifypeople #notdroolinghonest 
i think may just be my new religion . such a smart lady ! 
woke up feeling ache-y , shakey and foggy of brain . everything aches . decided that , this time , i'm giving in instead of going in . 
you should definitely visit marsh's library , stacks better . ( geddit ? ! ) it's next to st patrick's cathedral . :) 
although farmer oake is rather pretty too ! 
and you know you have to feel it because it's your thing & no-one else's ? and you really wish you could blame someone & you can't because 
i would say the world's gone mad but of course that happened a long time ago . never unestimate people's capacity for stupidity though . 
it turns out that my default setting , when there's no-one around to push me is rfl - really fucking lazy . feeling a bit guilty . 
post-dog o'clock caesar salad is a goodly thing as it turns out . and more importantly , it's not the ben & jerry's lurking in the freezer . 
that thing where you go back to work after a week off & realise how mind-bendingly dull your job is ... 
it's raining , it's pouring , the big dog is snoring . #sundaymorningfrenzy 
if you haven't already & you live in the uk , pls sign this . i can't because i'm no longer resident ; it's important ! !LINK! 
#shamelessdogloversunite ;) x 
all-ways ! 
logistics of dog-sitting aside , i was never convinced that france , in the height of summer , was a good idea . although i hoped so for them ... 
finished the first two classes of my #flculture course this evening . nice , bite-sized pieces to open up new ideas & re-jig the brain a bit ! 
oh well , if the worst comes to the worst and i get hunted by pitchfork-wavings people , i can always shave it off and start again . 
sherlock & a fire ftw . 
button down shirts & a substantial chest - never a good thing . * sigh * * fidgets with afore-mentioned buttons * 
want to try a new scent in your home ? take three large hairy dogs for a walk in rain . come home , towel off , leave to steam . #aroma #therapy 
#mtvbrandnew josef salvat 
especially as i had no great affinity for the original speaker . 
it's one of those breezy , sunny-but-a-bit-cloudy days that makes me think i should be driving off into the distance . #technicalterms 
alarm went off this morning at 7 ; switched it off but didn't get to revel in the holiday feeling b / c i blacked out til 10.30 . #wipedout 
you played a breath-taking gig tonight , josef ; i hung on every note . thank you so much for an exquisite set . 
i appear to have dyed my hair black . this is not good . really , very not good ! note to self : don't read things while waiting for dye to work . 
what the hell is it ? ? ! 😮 
prince all the way ! 
i go out outside to the utility room to check on the boiler and , when i come out , ronnie's sitting in the trampoline & won't come in . #crazy 
have suddenly been struck with the question : if my co-workers were dogs , what would they be ? it's strangely entertaining . #mindwandering 
hah ! !LINK! 
my darling husband - and he is , y'know , even if - make it sound otherwise - is baking hot & sleep-deprived in france . not so much fun ... 
end verdict = entertaining but 2 & 3 weren't quite as absorbing as 1st . ralph fiennes ? * shudder * all kinds of ick . #imissalmasy . 
spent today looking at carpets & kitchen designs . this evening , went food shoppinh . now to walk dogs in the rain . pfft . #beingagroanup 
house of cards ; snuggled on the sofa with husband ; snoozy dogs . 
my right thumb nail is permanently stained yellow from peeling satsumas . i think i've got a minor addiction issue brewing . #healthyproblems 
my favourite necklace has knotted up into a cat's cradle . i want to wear it but i also want to leave the house . preferably today . gah . 
or possibly good morning , vietnam . could go either way really ... 
... while , despite my protestations , i clearly expect to achieve something more ' useful ' while i'm here without them . hmm . 
gracious , who wouldn't go there ? ;) 
yeah , they do that a lot . and then they send everything back frmo whence it came if you don't follow their trail . 
" i became a slave at 5 , and my saviour is now in prison . help me free him " : !LINK! 
this is the cold that brings to mind every ' there but for the grace of ... ' ever uttered . there is no mercy in this cold . 
i can totally totally do gluten-free until confronted by hazelnut chocolate croissants from lidl . they are , like , extenuating circumstances . 
oooh , ooh , ooh ! ! ! how incredibly exciting ; we will all keep our paws crossed for you & zeus . <3 <3 
anyway , yes , get you ! :) 
still , the terror has subsided & no dogs were required to rescue me . likely they'd squish me about until i made a comfy nest . clean bed ! ! 😍 
* swoon * !LINK! 
went to bed last night almost crying with tiredness - my rest is catcing up on me ? - only to have dogs barking for another hour or so . 
i expect she means " who wants to look like a man being a woman ? " i guess she missed rupaul ... ? #dimdimdim 
flowers not necessary at all , but we might need a 2nd car key one of these days ! :D 
watching grimm as part of my post-alcoholic binge recovery . still undecided , although i love monroe and hank . 
children wrangled , homework checked / advised on , dinner cooked , 2 loads of washing on , washing up done , dad & sprog chatted to ... 
it's ok , playing fixes everything ! leopardstown rd's a bit rubbish - ten minutes or so so far towards r / ab . 
what an amazing resource ! thank you for sharing ; i had no idea such a thing existed . :) 
if it's not daughter with her nail polish it's husband with shoe polish . #theyretryingtokillme 
just as well you're almost universally adored then , isn't it ? :) you could read the phone book and we'd listen ! 
i am still not sure that i am ready for today & it's more than half over . :) 
this evening was brought to you by jay-z's black album . what else would a short , fat , white woman in a mondeo estate be listening to ? 9 0:36 
this is incredibly sad because people deserve so much better . still can't believe that tory & co . are back in power . !LINK! 
a very soggy ronnie is now trying to make a nest under one of my dressing gowns that is hanging down over the back of a chair ! #morelaundry 
that's a really excellent idea ! 
wrenched from an achingly beautiful dream by my alarm clock . now cannot remember what it was about other than a lingering sadness it's over . 
also one of my favourites : lamb - trans fatty acid . !LINK! 
yep , that's been me too ! :) !LINK! 
the sort of morning in work that makes me wish i was a housewife . ( hint : i never want to be a housewife . ) 
imperfectly balanced . !LINK! 
when surrounded by multitudinous stupid people , sometimes it's helpful to admit it to oneself . 
am looking for my very own muddy peacock for a new blog - bit hippyish - and wondered if i might proposition you ! 
believe me , there are oodles of incoherent irish people . but perhaps you've not been escorted around their preferred locales ... ? 
i got 1/2 way through last night but it has chris.walken in it w / mesmerising hair & usual immobile face . also , helena b-c . 
it's bone-deep cold tonight ; stars glittering icily in the sky & diamond-dusted fields as the frost settles . there is no mercy in this cold . 
seems to be a common theme in the collective consciousness atm & i find it enthralling : who are we w / o name , titles , adjectives ? #nowords 
was going to say that i would gladly chip in on the adoption fee if there was a home for him chèz vous . 
oh . oh . jo ! ! ! two years ? how was he not snapped up in a heartbeat ? ? 
i completely get what you mean . when i saw ronnie's photo , just * knew * he was mine . completely overruled dave ! 
watching ' equilibrium ' - what a horror show ! 
no words . rt : four to face trial over brutal street stabbing of chained dog !LINK! !LINK! " 
indescribably pleased that he gets exactly what he most wanted for once . 
sadly that doesn't look likely but worse things happen at sea , i'm sure . :D

this is absolutely wonderful . loved every word ; it covers so much that you talked about in last post . thank you for sharing . 
i've started though . have put rings back in my ears & a stud in my nose . have looped my sacred heart & sapphire around my neck . talismen all 
cleaned boiler w / husband , scraped off soot & ash , went out for dinner w / sprog alpha & better half . now home , dog walking & sleeps . #happy 
it appears i've been running marathons or kick-boxing in my sleep . feel like i've been beaten all over . #boohiss 
also , the thing about holidays is that you have to come back . i think this is why i distrust them . 
and we should , wherever possible , do what we love ! i hope yours is a good ' un . :) 
if there is happiness , this's it , coffee , a table in a window bathed in perfect autumn evening sun , a bag full o ' books & time to enjoy them 
watching ' s sigh of contentment when embarking upon a frankly obscenely large pumpkin spice latté . it's a happy thing . 
watching camp xray ; it's surprisingly good . kristen stewart has found her métier apparently . 
i'm having a deeply satisfying day today , largely because i've been fixing problems & getting things moving . now i'm home for a looong w / e . 
nope , not really . i don't live outside . in the same way , i do live in my life . escapism is exactly that . 
every cloud has a furry lining & a wagging tail ! as says , it's fab that he's so wanted . big hugs . 
!LINK! cold days and colder night . #themuddypeacock 
bare arms , bare legs , coloured like rainbows , with dogs , and babies , and infinite beauty . so many stories , so many ripples across the water . 
avengers : age of ultron for prob'ly the 20th time . shrimp fancies captain america & thor . i fancy bruce banner . we both win . #marvelobsessed 
the rain on the first night off washed away my shell ; i feel raw & vulnerable . i'm not sure if i can build another by 8.30 tomorrow . 
let's face it , if you're 5 ' 2 " or under , changing a king size duvet cover is terrifying . i almost gave up and spent the night in there . 
* shopping 
children tucked in , dogs fed , walked & watered ... get so much done when my husband's not home ! #weirdness 
foggy days . !LINK! 
snippets . !LINK! 
the bear is all curled up in his basket making snoozing noises - would quite like to magically shrink so i could curl up next to his warmth . 
as in getting one's kit off ? 
hello ! no spammy comments , nor apologies required . wp can be a bit of an arse at times . :) 
dad's moving in for two weeks from tomorrow . equal parts delighted and horrified . will be lovely to see him but , then again , two weeks ... 
slowly re-emerging from cocoon & back to ' normal . ' the people walking past w / their own stories & lives are heart-breakingly beautiful . 
have been looking forward to this all week : comfy seats , a little bag of treats & something fun to watch . #cinemasolo 
so much sunshine . unexpected and delicious . 
incredible ! thank you for sharing , . such sonorous tones , too . !LINK! 
i don't believe that anyone is ever just a housewife - it's bloody hard work ! - but it's something i was never good at ! :) 
i'm a horrible cliché but i love starbucks . coffee stuff's fine but it's the space , the anonymity . for me , coffee shops = a kind of freedom . 
!LINK! this is so very powerful & i can't stop listening . 
yes , but ' free reign ' has a better cartoon potential : all those windsors shaking off their bridles & bits ... 
is there anything more frustrating that a house full of non-morning people when you get up earlier than any of them during the week ? 
paws ! ! ! rt : amazing tranq'd #canadian #lynx at the #detrichnativespeciestreatmentcenter . those paws ! 
i did exactly the same thing to dave earlier today . :D it's ok , , i understand the pain ! 
do you know , i think i'm ready for them all to come back now . the crazy is strong out there and i like my crazies where i can see ' em . 😃 
watched page eight and now on turks & caicos . have never enjoyed bill nighy in anything before . thanks , ! :) x 
right . mopped and hoovered . maybe some dinner ? 
as if we needed more excuses to read ng ... ! ;D 
talking about food in work : the various merits & demerits of chinese takeaways ... #hungry 
i went to ikea & bought exciting things . like , umm , blinds & a new cooking pan . & more of those stick-on-the-wall baskets for the bathroom . 
the office's like a bag of cats today : it's all hissing & claws & taking offence . something in the air ?

counting all my blessings today - small daughter has been accepted into the 2ndry school that her dad & i went to . this is glorious news ! 
rest , and a revival of long-ago plans . !LINK! 
dogs settled , children in bed , washing sorted ; our little world hushes and settles . #lastnightoftheholidays 
hah ! well , sometimes an outside view can be helpful ... :) 
in a crazy-happy-dance-giggly-fizzy mood today . turns out having a real rest over the weekend is a pretty good thing to do ! #whoknew ? 
i'm not sure because , as a brit , i would also say ' get your kit on and let's go . ' 
well , be fair , you're certainly pretty high on the list for all kinds of wordiness . :) 
this is true at first glance , but it is often the way of things that one's focus must drift at some point . surely ... ? 
mabel ! ! ! 😍 💕 
bloody husband is cleaning his shoes in the bedroom - everything reeks of shoe polish . why would anyone do such a thing ? ? 
today is going to be a clearing the decks kind of day . and when the place is clean , i have sage to smudge with & i am not afraid to use it . 
i find myself quite unable to leave my bed this morning . #wornout #comfy 
haven't watched the doctor since wotsisface came aboard . also , clara . just no . 
* sniff * oh dear . am sad now . :( 
why was william's wife - can't remember her name , sorry ! - wearing a satellite dish on her head ? #troopingthecolour 
clearly i just am so #svb ! !LINK! 
pack an extra life jacket just in case ... ? i am sure there will be smooth sailing aplenty . 
guaranteed to permeate every corner of your home . works especially well on soft furnishings . 
we all got back to the car soaked and dripping but , somehow , also very pleased . felt like it cleared the work dust and bad vibes away . 
speaking of best , four day working weeks are awesome . i wish this was a permanent thing . 
i don't know what it is about being woken up mid-dream that hurts so much . i feel ruffled & out of sorts for the day usually . 
craving something gentle so watching ' possession ' while the rest of the household watch ' captain america . ' can see neil gaiman playing ashe . 
he still has some of my cds . we still keep each other company that way . 
* underestimate 
damn . i always make that mistake with " i wonder ... " it sounds like a question even though it isn't . #numpty 
perfect is not a thing to concern yourself with . especially not where relationships are involved . #whatidtell18yearoldme 
uncool as it is , summer's too loose for me . i need some structure , some routine . it is this that allows me space to be frivolous / wanton . 
a friend of evie's introduced her to ouat - i'm not sure i can forgive her , it's terrible ... and compelling . also , sequins ! 
although i can't imagine who'd want fox-hunting brought back . 
wandering round #easons in a daze . dear gods , i bloody love stationery . no phone , tablet , laptop or gadget can ever compare ! 
the window's open , birds are tweetling , dogs are snoring , the sun is shining . i think my mind , body and soul needs ' peaceful ' for a while . 
a woman just came up to me to tell me that ireland are winning at rugby today . bless her , she was so happy ! :) #springdays 
sometimes , being a groan-up sucks . still , it will be nice to have some privacy in the kitchen again , assuming ronnie-bear doesn't kill them . 
disembowelled you with a blunt spoon ? and you don't know whether you want to scream , or throw things , or curl up & die ? 
ronnie's gleaming in the sunshine & fudge's coat is like silk in the afternoon light . i have such beautiful dog friends ! 
autumn leaves ; erykah badu ; traffic jams mean time to think . 
was up at 3.20 am to take dad the airport ; he's off to sorrento for a week . sun rise on the way back was lovely . back to bed , slept til 12 . 
in years to come , you're going to need #bleachbaths . it's a thing . remember ! it will save you time , pain , & stress . #whatidtell18yearoldme 
i just walked past an elderly lady sitting in her parked car reading a book . i was so tempted to tap on the window & say " me too ! i do that " 
i am imbolc , the dream of awakening . !LINK! #rebellesociety 
plan for today fucked . sprog a almost missed birthday party because he'd forgotten about it . sniffy text from other parent . understandable .

much beloved colleague from the netherlands has brought in the . best . chocolate crammed with roasted hazelnuts . so good ! 
home before 5 on a friday . #thisisthesweetlife 
but the ' this ' was never going to be able to withstand the ' that ' . i don't think anyone could cut me deeper if they tried . 
but what a plucky young chap , sprinting through the streets , eh ? </barf> 
#butplentyofrepetitionhopefully . 
i think ronnie's freaked out that the other human members of his pack not here . he's feeling a little vulnerable ... 
do you know that feeling where you feel so hurt that you can only gulp air & wait for the tears to stop ? when it feels someone has 
sleeping , writing , grocery shopping . today has flown by when doing nothing in particular . i would like more time please . 
she was making little siren noises a moment ago . 
i think there may be chips in our future ! sunshine , blue skies & a blue , blue sea . #springdays #springblessings 
thank you . don't know if you made this or if they came from elsewhere but they are gems , each and every one . 
perish the thought ! !LINK! 
the thing about staying up all night to finish speed-watching #californication is that i now have a hank hangover ! ' s ace ! 
milkshake , fries , garlic mushrooms & balthasar's odyssey by amin maalouf . #goodtimes #garlicmayonnaiseisheavenly 
i think this is true of all men but i love the words . !LINK! 
feeling oddly raw today . if i were a victorian woman , i'd be sure to keep my smelling salts handy & would probably recline in a dark room . 
also , why does winona ryder now look like céline dion ? it's a worrying development , i feel . 
uniforms , stationery , books , socks , stuff ! and we only have two children ... 
and sprog alpha got his birthday present a week and a bit early because half term warrants it . he's now the v . proud owner of an xbox 1 . 
slow . slow . slooow . 
i don't know but if the tory party's behaviour towards humans is anything to go by , it's not entirely a shock . 
you knew it was coming all the time and just didn't want to face it . because the ' this ' in question was different and stronger . 
#rhcp : ' scar tissue . ' oh , john frusciante , you kill me in the best possible ways .

sizzling onions & garlic , sam cooke on the stereo : that'll do , pig , that'll do . #contentment 
just took dogs for a very late walk . and after weeks of what has seemed like no rain , it poured . i mean , really , really poured ! #timing 
there's a big butter-ball moon in the sky tonight playing hide & seek with the stars behind slinking black cat clouds . 
this is , i understand , the epitome of 1st world problems but we live what we know . 
ah , but it was never intended to be comforting , merely to encourage acceptance of the fact .

the man who fell from grace with the sea : that kid is deeply , deeply creepy . and his mother's a lunatic ! still , recommended ... 
mind you , three is an awkward number of dogs to have . only having two arms when everyone wants a cuddle's tricky . #needydogs

as a woman with three rottie cross dogs , i'd say that dude can fuck right off . all mine are distinctly unmanly ! 
sometimes pathetic begging works . ;) 
so multiple mochas , two new pairs of boots , lunch with one of my favourite people , and all on a perfect sunny day . does it get any better ? ! 
the only thing working properly for me today in work is the internet - specifically etsy & the book depository . i think it's a sign .

september , welcome . you're a sight for sore eyes , and a blessing . #autumnsmyfavourite 
the sun's been clouded out by mist & clouds . there's a steady procession of cars & bad parking outside this window . it's still awesome . 
why do nick & juliette even both putting food on the table ? as soon as something's cooked , someone knocks on the door witha drama ! #grimm 
dogs really do make the most entertaining noises when they sleep . i'm not sure what honey's dreaming of but it sounds like a block-buster ! 
:) 
it's really quite chilly tonight . #julyinireland 
i don't think a more beautiful day could be possible ! warm enough for t-shirts , gorgeous sun , & perfect autumnal yumminess . 
i did that . everyone else went off to france but me & the hounds . they came home grumpy but i had a lovely time ! 
just realised , - it's the same gang that did the constant gardener ... they've just switched who gets to kiss rachel weisz . :) 
today , i left the house . voluntarily . there's hope , y'all . #myhermitgameisstrong

why're all these creepy kids running around in ginormous houses ? and why do they have these ridiculous accents ? 
yogi liquorice tea . * swoon * sweetly delicious . 
dad went home yesterday ; everyone took the day off to recover . * exhales * now trying to decide what to do with my day off . 
i am so relieved it's september . every year i say it , & every year it's true . the summer is too pressured , there're too many expectations . 
feeling dreadful and , tbh , a little sorry for myself . this is the sort of headache that makes you want to just pass out & have done . 
this week ’ s happy . !LINK! 
mmmm , brains ! 
* applause * well done ! 
yes ! am busy doing exactly that ! :) 
sadly , this is all too true . most of the ppl i work with have no clue how privileged they are - they complain about everything 
luther . it's definitely growing on me . plus , y'know , idris elba . 
i think two days of hibernation have worked wonders . tomorrow , long walks beckon : fresh air , trees or sea all sorely needed . 
love that album so much . i know she got so much flak for it but there was something so pure in her intent . 
today , my little victory is that i have milk chocolate butter biscuits . the chocolate overlaps the edge so you can bite it off separately . 
it's a bit like having a smaller club milk bar . not sure if people living outside ireland will understand the reference ... 
never can entirely understand why i like sunshine as much when i'm inside inside as when i'm out . it's enough that it's there somehow . 
the same people , of course , who judge you for sleeping later at the weekend ! :D 
this evening's entertainment may just be ruined by the world's stinkiest dog . can i borrow a gas mask please ? someone ? * faints * 
ooooh , i thought i was the vicious one around here ? ;D #notsayingyourewrong 
work life and the whinging wife . !LINK! 
awww ! what a beauty . :) 
i'm pretty sure that should be the other way around ... 
ok . hoovered & mopped . feeling less shifty now . funny how i expect my family to do nothing more taxing than lazing at the pool on hols ... 
this evening , i got to speak to one of my favourite engineers . we worked together for three years & he's one of the best people i know . 
am hoping she won't be too upset not to be following her friends to the school up the road though . i think she'll <3 it when she gets there . 
valentine's day ? i hate the commercialism but still got cards for husband , kids , and father . oh , and chocolate . #secretsap 
something old , something new , something fantastically blue . !LINK! 
jameson & fizzy apple squash : who knew , eh ? :) 
another afternoon nap that stretched out a little too long - bliss ! 
unless one has chickens , can't imagine there's anything bad about foxes ! we see them around the suburbs of dublin too . 
that sucks , and i'm genuinely sorry . is it possible that your friend was just a colossal bitch ? 
someone has probably already sent you this but ... it's our elephant in the room , complete with sequins ! !LINK! 
tesco's caesar salad in a bag : undoubtedly wrong but undeniably delicious . also , cheap . #bonus 
juliette is crap . #grimm 
i have done it ! i've been shopping and we now have supplies . #hermitmodeengaged don't have to talk to anyone until tomorrow evening ! 
i suspect that says more about my laziness than my integral good nature somehow . 😕 
someone told me today that i have a voice for radio . i know i certainly have the face for it . visions of book at bedtime beckoning . 
i can't think why , but it seemed like a good idea to watch an oprah interview w / the kardashians . they are astonishingly incoherent . 
today , i was struggling . and then i went to hang out with my daughter for a bit & saw the sunshine landing gently . it helped . #myrayoflight 
he's the only reason i've watched more . i looove rc & the incredible mobility of his face ! 
there is something indescribably good about lying in bed on a sunday , listening to the birds sing and the world continuing its day . 
veggies ! the joy ! haven't eaten anything properly good for two days now and feel rubbish as a result . 
achey , sore , tiiired . when does the tiiired stop ?
