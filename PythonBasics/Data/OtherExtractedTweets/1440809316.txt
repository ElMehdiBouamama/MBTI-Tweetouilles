i'm almost starting to feel at ease with 8bits asm hu6280 , but the code is so tight that any change messes up everything .

philia jagcd : part 1 works from start to end ! reduced audio frequency due to bus overhead caused by op ( large sprites ) , gave me extra ram ! 
seems like a new sms game : 
trying an accelerometer controlled alice , well ... nope ! 
double buffering ? naah let's use 32 screen buffers , now see the rendering buffer position being chased by the viewer buffer position =) 
i will drop my developer hat for a moment and start making lots of packagings , huge number of people ordered my new game alice for jaguar :) 
doing games promotion is time consuming 
i will make a tos desktop watchface for my pebble :) 
trying pre-generated 68000 asm code to draw fast horizontal lines on megacd cpu , i must find small jump table solution , i dont have much ram 
when i will receive the cds from the factory ... 
it's hard to resist starting a new project , which you know is too complicated to finish , and which is almost useless . 
random crash of my sprite manager + slow ( 30/25 fps ) scrolling due to using blitter instead of op tricks ( to harsh for me ) 
1982 touchscreen , before it was cool !LINK! 
it's an actual game i made from several oga gfx !LINK! :) 
who needs a #retrovgs .. just use a raspberry pi 2 + sd as cartridges , an rpi 2 is at least 10 times the power of a dreamcast for only 40 € !

growing megacd collection ! ( my own late christmas presents :p )
