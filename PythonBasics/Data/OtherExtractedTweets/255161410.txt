y'a plein de superbes citations everlark dans mockingjay qu'on oublie : " you'll never be able to let him go . " " i don't know why his voice 
a fan i've been talking to and who went to the premiere last year told me that it was basically the same 
ah d'accord . 
" except for you stiles . what do you turn into ? " " an abominable snowman . but it's more of a winter time thing , you know seasonal . " 
anyway i swear we are civilised people , i just don't get why a lot of people who go to big premiers seem to have no idea why 
grave on me l'a dit tout le temps en angleterre : " your english is so good , where did you learn how to speak it ? " 
" it's a club . we were clubbing . at the club . " #tw #2x06 
‚ô• pardon 
so after , when he whispers : you love me . real or not real ? " i tell him : " real . " 
carpet and you don't have to buy a super expensive ticket to come

j'ai vu mockingjay ! ! ! j'ai surv√©cu ! ! ! 
meuuuh non pas toi ‚ô• 
et elle : " do you know what we say in england ? we say that there is no american accent , it's just mispronunciation of words " 
" yeah , a lot of things should count for something that don't seem to , katniss . i've got some memories i can't make sense of , and 
mouais 
" they say time is supposed to heal ya but i haven't done much healing " 
bavard ! 
regarder 
dit : nooo , no way ! ! ! et si . et si ... 
" i don't know why his voice reaches me when no one else's can " 
and most fans would have been able to answer these questions . i just get the feeling that these people were 
piti√© , pas david hallyday . #mockingjayparispremiere 
aha tu me rassures merci ‚ô• 
specifically to satisfy fans . ‚Äú it is toward the end of the film , he said . ‚Äî " ‚Äù

" challenging and hard " ptdrr 
dit : " you want to say tomatoes because if you say " tomatoes " , that's american .. " moi : " oh yeah sorry old american accent " 
" you're still trying to protect me , real or not real ? " " real . because that's what we do , you and i . protect each other . " 
" and if i'm gonna die , i wanna still be me " . and now i'm crying because of hijacked peeta #hungergames #D8

hahaha 
thing last year with crazy girls in groups pushing them etc . - ___ - 
don't worry again ‚ô• 
much more excited and at the same time much more civilised ... that's because you need to pay to see the movie in the theater 
mais ouais le " than more happened on the train than did " est quand m√™me perturbant . ' ^ ^ ^ 
anyway after they showed the inside of the theater and people seemed muuuch more excited , screamed a lot etc 
pretty sure people screamed there too ... we just couldn't hear them idk if you see what i mean 
arff ... =/

sad i hope it didn't ruin the experience for you :(

pesant haha
